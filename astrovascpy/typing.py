    Required parameters used in the model:

    Args:
        vasc_axis: vasculature axis corresponding to x, y, or z. Should be set to 0, 1, or 2.
        depth_ratio: depth along the vasc_axis. This is the portion of the vasculature where there are inputs.
        max_nb_inputs: maximum number of entry nodes where we inject the flow into the vasculature. Should be >= 1.
        blood_viscosity: plasma viscosity in :math:`g\, \mu m^{-1}\, s^{-1}`.
        base_pressure: reference pressure in :math:`g \, \mu m^{-1}\, s^{-2}`. At resting state equal to the external pressure

    (Optional) Stochastic simulation parameters:

    Args:

        entry_noise: Boolean value to enable or disable the endfeet activity on entry nodes.

        threshold_r: radius (Âµm) threshold. A radius smaller than the threshold is considered a capillary. A radius bigger than the threshold is considered an artery.

        c_cap: constant used in the ROU parameter calibration for capillaries
        c_art: constant used in the ROU parameter calibration for arteries

        max_r_capill: max radius change factor for capillaries.
        t_2_max_capill: time (in seconds) to reach r_max_capill from 0.
        max_r_artery: max radius change factor for arteries.
        t_2_max_artery: time (in seconds) to reach r_max_artery from 0.

    (Optional) PETSc Linear solver parameters:

    Args:
        solver: iterative linear solver used by PETSc
        max_it: maximum number of solver iterations
        r_tol: relative tolerance

blood_viscosity: 1.2e-6 # plasma viscosity in g.Âµm^-1.s^-1

vasc_axis: 1  # vasculature axis corresponding to x, y, or z. Should be set to 0, 1, or 2.
depth_ratio: 0.05  # Depth along the vasc_axis. This is the portion of the vasculature where there are inputs.
max_nb_inputs: 3 # maximum number of inputs to inject flow/pressure into vasculature. Should be >= 1.

p_base: 1.33e-3  # reference pressure in g * um^{-1} * s^{-2}. At resting state equal to the external pressure


### OU calibration parameters

threshold_r: 3  # Radius (in micro-meters) threshold.
# A radius smaller than the threshold is considered a capillary.
# A radius bigger than the threshold is considered an artery.

# Capillaries
max_r_capill: 1.38   # max radius change factor
mean_r_capill: 1.09  # mean radius change factor
t_2_max_capill: 2.7  # time (in seconds) to reach r_max from 0

# Arteries
max_r_artery: 1.23   # max radius change factor
mean_r_artery: 1.11  # mean radius change factor
t_2_max_artery: 3.3  # time (in seconds) to reach r_max from 0
